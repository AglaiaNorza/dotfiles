slowly building something i like (and learning so much from it!!!)

my favourite out of my i3blocks configs:

another decent one:
![i3icons](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7072c22-c2dd-4481-9b4e-e411e1699752)

an old one i don't really like:
![i3old](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00c244ef-b38c-4d6a-8b9e-495eb0fc6732)

(how my i3 looks overall - technically tokyo night)
