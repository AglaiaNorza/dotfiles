slowly building something i like (and learning so much from it!!!)

my favourite out of the i3blocks configs i did:

another (less depressing) one:
![i3icons](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5dba28cd-9a48-442a-b406-8b366d428e9d)

an old one i don't really like:
![i3old](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00c244ef-b38c-4d6a-8b9e-495eb0fc6732)

(my i3 is technically supposed to be tokyo night-ish (for now))
