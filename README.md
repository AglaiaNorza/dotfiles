my config files for my arch + i3 setup(s, i use them on both my PC and laptop).

i'm slowly building something i like (and learning so much from it!!!) (i know very little but i love learning/knowledge in general, so !)

(i really have nothing to do, so i made a basic script that switches and edits some files, effectively changing the theme of the main things i use (and my keyboard rgb)):
